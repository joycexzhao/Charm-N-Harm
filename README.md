# Charm-N-Harm
A simple top-down dungeon crawler. Move using WASD or arrow keys, and attack by clicking the screen. Hold shift to switch to a shield to block incoming projectiles. Charm your way through four levels and a boss room to beat the game!

Built with Unity in C# by Iris Ely, Jaime Acosta, Joyce Zhao, and Sofian Rahhali.
